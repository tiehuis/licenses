# licenses

An archive of plaintext licenses which can be easily retrieved via some tool
such as wget.

See [the site](https://tiehuis.github.io/licenses) for details.

# Format

All licenses have project-specific values enclosed in `[]`. The format is
similar to that of [choosealicense](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com).

Any post-processing can always assume these rules for all present licenses.
